# Election_Analysis
Election Analysis Using Python 
Finding out voting information for each county using Python

#Purpose of the election audit

The purpose of this project is to find out which county is the largest according to the election results. During this module we learned how to read csv files in python and began to run the data with the coding skills we acquired. The data file has 4 columns, we need to search through the one that had all of the candidates and figure out how many votes each candidate recieved from the voters. When we find the total votes and percentage for each candidate,  we will submit a text file with a winner.

#Election audit results: 
#By County: Total 369,711 votes of 3 counties. Jefferson county had 10.5% of the election with 38,855 total votes, Denver had 82.8% of the election with 306,055 total votes, and Arapahoe had 6.7% of the election with 24,801 voted. Denver had the hightest number of votes among the counties with 82.8%. 
#By Candidate: Charles Casper Stockham(85,213 with 23%), Diana DeGette(272,892 with 73.8%), and Raymon Anthony Doane(11,606 with 3.1%). Diana DeGette won the election recieving 272,892 total votes which was 73.8% of the total votes in the election.
